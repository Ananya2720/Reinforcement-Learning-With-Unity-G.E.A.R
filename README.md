# Reinforcement Learning With Unity - Garbage Evaporating Autonomous Robot
__ADD A PICTURE HERE__

This is a project completed by three students (Damian Bogunowicz, Sangram Gupta, HyunJung Jung) in conjunction with the Chair for Computer Aided Medical Procedures & Augmented Reality of the Technical Universitz of Munich. We have created a prototype of an autonomous, intelligent agent for garbage collection named G.E.A.R (Garbage Evaporating Autonomous Robot). The goal of the agent is collect relevant pieces of garbage, while avoiding collisions with static objects (such as chairs or tables). The input, which allows the agent to navigate environment (a mock-up of German Oktoberfest tent) is the camera's RGBD input. 

The purpose of this project was to broaden our knowledge in the areas of Reinforcement Learning, Game Development and 3D Computer Vision. If you would like to get more familiar with our work, the detailed description of the project can be found [here](www.todo.com)



## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

* [Unity 3D and Unity ML-Agents Toolkit](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Installation.md) 

## Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

### G.E.A.R Training & Inference
